Equating  hallucinations with (dark) magic was the beginning of the prohibitive approach applied to these substances during the Colonial period. In his multi-volume ethnographic project, La Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España / The Universal History of the Things of New Spain, Bernardino de Sahagún wrote on the subject: “Its leaves are slender, cord-like, small. Its name is ololiuhqui. It makes one besotted; it deranges one, troubles one, maddens one, makes one possessed. He who eats it, who drinks it, sees many things which greatly terrify him. He is really frightened [by the] poisonous serpent which he sees for that reason. He who hates people causes on to swallow it in drink [and] food to madden him.”  Ololiuhqui  has been identified as Christmas vine / Morning Glory (Ipomoea corymbosa / Turbina corymbosa, Granziera, 2001).  Images of the plant ornamenting Sahagún’s unique book are among the first sites of visual mediation of psychoactive precursors from the Americas [^1].
